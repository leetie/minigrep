Twas the night before working, when all through the house,
Not a Jesse was sleeping, (not the case for his spouse)

To be up in three hours, he had to be,
Which was kind of fucked up, not a reason for glee

Instead of him sleeping, which would have been smart,
He stared at the terminal, learning his art

There were things to debug, all the programs, the errors!
He had no time for other frivilous cares

So he typed away, cursing all the while,
Any reason this motherfucking source wouldn't compile

When finally; Eureka! An end to this damnation!
He would consult the language documentation!

A parameter change here.. some expressions there..
Soon this problem would be out of his hair

Again, once more, he tried to compile,
And again, ... the same message, he found to be vile

Only this time, he stared a little closer at the screen,
He was missing a semicolon on line 113
